After I made my first Algorithm, I was really glued to it. 
It was incredibly fun, and I wanted to tackle some more, bigger, and cooler algorithms. 
So, I decided this would be my 4th big C# project.

---------------------------------------------------

My focus (again) was on writing clean and good code so that others could easily work on it and add algorithms or other stuff.

Originally, I made the Maze Generation algorithm and the Right-Hand Rule algorithm as two separate console app prototypes. 
Then I decided to scale up to a WPF application with animations, controls, and even more algorithms. 
In the end, theres one Gen algorithm and five solve algorithms (A*, BFS, DeadEndFill, Right/LeftHand and Random).

It took me about 20 days, coding 4-6 hours a day, to bring the project to this point.


As always, I tried to do as much as possible myself. 
The generation, Random, and Right/LeftHand algorithms were all made 100% by myself (idea and coding) without any Googling. 
With the BFS, I only read an explanation of how it works and understood it very quickly, for A* I needed quite some help.


This is by far my best and coolest project I made to this day (August 13, 2025). 
Im very proud and think I managed to achieve my goals (mainly clean/better code). 
I believe the code is good enough for other people to work on, so please feel free to add something if you want! 
The project will also be upgraded soon; next, I want to add some sorting algorithms.


There's still one bug I couldnt really fix yet: If the animation runs (doesnt matter which one) and you focus something in the GUI (Text/ComboBox for example), 
the animation speeds up significantly while the GUI is focused. 
I think its because of WPF prioritizing some threads, but I couldnt really figure it out yet.
The biggest struggle of the project wasnt even really the algorithms, but the GUI stuff. 
I had a lot of performance problems with big mazes but was able to fix most of it. 
And it runs very well now. 

---------------------------------------------------

I learned a lot in this project, especially about clean and maintainable code, and of course about algorithms (which are very fun).

Like I said; if you want to add something to the program yourself, feel free to do that!
